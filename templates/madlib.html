    <p>Today a {{job}} named {{noun}} came to our school to talk to us about her job. She said the most important skill you need to know to do her job is to be able to {{verb}} around (a) {{adj}} {{noun_two}}. She said it was easy for her to learn her job because she loved to {{verb_two}} when she was my age--and that helps a lot! If you're considering her profession, I hope you can be near (a) {{adj_two}} {{noun_three}}. That's very important! If you get too distracted in that situation you won't be able to {{verb_three}} next to (a) {{noun_four}}!</p>
